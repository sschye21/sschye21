<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm currently a student studying a Bachelor of Computer Science/Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) at UNSW! I'm constantly trying to find ways to
  upskill and improve myself everyday both professionally and personally! Whilst I have a passion for software development and engineering, I don't let
  that detract from my involvement in Tennis (used to play 1sts in High School), and am always keen for a match!</p>
